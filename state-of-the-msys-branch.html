<h2>State of the MSYS Branch</h2>

<p>My MSYS branch now properly differentiates between the MSYS and MINGW32 subsystems, but both options still have issues.</p>

<p>The MINGW32 build creates a native Windows binary, which doesn't play well with the virtual paths used by msys-perl. I'm getting around that by <a href="https://github.com/gerdr/parrot/blob/gerdr/msys/lib/MSYS/MinGW.pm">monkey patching</a> the core modules <code>Cwd</code> and <code>File::Spec</code>.</p>

<p>That's clearly a hack, but there does not seem to be a silver bullet for this particular problem, and this approach has been <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/msysgit/browse_thread/thread/87ea9c3125d0fb8e/99375e2b77bd46aa#anchor_01e5df4b6ff350e1">suggested previously</a> during a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/msysgit/browse_thread/thread/87ea9c3125d0fb8e/99375e2b77bd46aa">related discussion</a>.</p>

<p>I did not yet fix the test regressions introduced by <a href="https://github.com/gerdr/parrot/commit/ad25aa96b975d06d9354da998c328666a20b7156">commit ad25aa9</a> as I was busy setting up a vanilla MSYS environment for work on the MSYS subsystem (<em>had some issues compiling git, but got it to work eventually</em>).</p>

<p>The MSYS build currently compiles, but <code>make</code> fails due to path mismatches. Fixing these might call for introduction of a new platform built from the <code>win32</code> and <code>generic</code> ones. Alternatively, some new <code>#ifdef __MSYS__</code> blocks could probably be added to the <code>win32</code> code.</p>
